		<h2 id="AboutNirvana">About Nirvana</h2>

		
		<p style="color:OrangeRed;">Nirvana was an American grunge rock band that was formed by singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic in Aberdeen, Washington in 1987.  Nirvana went through a succession of drummers, the longest-lasting being Dave Grohl, who joined the band in 1990.  Despite releasing only three full-length studio albums in their seven-year career, Nirvana has come to be regarded as one of the most influential and important rock bands of the modern era.</p>

		<p>Cobain described the sound of Nirvana when it first started as "a Gang of Four and Scratch Acid ripoff". When Nirvana recorded Bleach, Cobain felt he had to fit the expectations of the Sub Pop grunge sound to build a fanbase, and hence suppressed his arty and pop songwriting traits while crafting the record in favor of a more rocking sound. Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad argued, "Ironically, it was the restrictions of the Sub Pop sound helped the band find its musical identity". Azerrad stated that by acknowledging that its members had grown up listening to Black Sabbath and Aerosmith, the band was able to move on from its derivative early sound.Cobain sought to mix heavy and pop musical sounds; he commented, "I wanted to be totally Led Zeppelin in a way and then be totally extreme punk rock and then do real wimpy pop songs". When Cobain heard the Pixies's 1988 album Surfer Rosa after recording Bleach, he felt it had the sound he wanted to achieve but until then was too imitated to try. The Pixies' subsequent popularity encouraged Cobain to follow his instincts as a songwriter.</p>
